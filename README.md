PoC of detecting stack pivots using eBPF

# Stack Pivots

Situation: you have a stack-based buffer overflow and can overwrite the
saved RIP to get code execution. You have a ROP chain payload, but it
is too large to deliver with the overflow that you have, or otherwise fit
on the stack. Enter the stack pivot!

Using a `leave; ret;` gadget (or other gadgets) we take control of the RSP
register, thus pivoting the stack somewhere we control for the next gadgets to
be popped from. Now we can split our ROP chain into stages. The full ROP chain
is placed wherever it will fit (such as the heap) and is our 2nd stage. The 1st
stage ROP chain simply pivots to it, and can be very small. This is very
useful.

## Detecting Stack Pivots

This should be easy enough: instrument likely syscalls a ROP chain would use,
and check if the stack pointer is outside the stack region for the process.
This requires tracking each thread's stack region, which is unfortunately tricky.

# Stacks & Thread Stacks

A single-threaded process on Linux has a more well-defined stack, tracked both
in the memory mappings of the current task's `task_struct` (`mm` field points
to VMAs which can have `VM_STACK` flag set in their `vm_flags` field), and in
the process's `mm_struct` `start_stack` field (initial stack for main thread).

Unfortunately this is definitely inaccurate for multithreaded programs. Each
thread in a process must have its own stack since the memory space is shared
with other threads, but the previously mentioned 'stack' entries in the kernel
are inaccurate for locating the actual stack in use by a thread.

This can be observed by running a multithreaded program and observing its
`/proc/$pid/maps` list of memory regions, only one of which is marked as the
stack.

## Tracking Thread Stacks

Fortunately Anthony Blanton did research on properly tracking thread stacks
using eBPF programs
(https://gitlab.rim.net/bart/bpftest/-/blob/85df2d83b95e96cfa26c5635c1d3c29684202b25/libbpf-core/prog.c).
Ultimately, the `clone` syscall observes the new thread's stack via the `newsp`
parameter, used during thread creation. However we won't know the new thread's
tid until `clone` is returning. Likewise a retprobe would have the new tid, but
no longer have the newsp parameter.

One solution (try this later) would be to store the newsp in a map for the
retprobe to retrieve. The currently implemented solution uses the approach
outlined by Anthony, using `wake_up_new_task` as a point to observe both the
new stack pointer, and the new thread's tid.

This is focused on the view of threads from the kernel, so while testing of
libraries beyond pthread should happen, if a thread library relies on the
`clone` system call to implement its threads at the OS level (thus letting the
kernel handle scheduling, signals, etc.) then this approach should still be
useful.

# Building

## Dependencies

You'll need (at least) the following packages to build, based on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS.
Some may already be installed, or have to be explicitly installed.

```
build-essential
pkg-config
libelf-dev
zlib1g-dev
clang
cargo
rustfmt
linux-tools-`uname -r`
```

## Build Process

First you'll need the correct vmlinux.h file for your running kernel. I
generated mine with `bpftool btf dump file /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux format c`,
using a bpftool for my kernel version. On ubuntu I installed bpftool using 
`apt install linux-tools-`uname -r``.

You can then build with `cargo build`. The `build.rs` file will include
the bpf program building automatically. You will also need to install the
`rustfmt` utility for the libbpf-rs crate to build the rust skeleton for
the eBPF object.

## Building Docker Image

To run on Kubernetes, we need our PoC in a docker container. To build this
container we will additionally need docker. The `Dockerfile` file has
everything necessary to build the project in a container and place the main
build artifact in a docker image. For the convenience of getting this image
named "stack_pivot_poc", build by running the `build-container.sh` script.

Once built, you can get an interactive shell in the image with
`docker run --privileged -it stack_pivot_poc`, or just run the PoC itself
with `docker run --privileged stack_pivot_poc`. The `--privileged` flag is
necessary to use eBPF.

# Running

Binaries will be under `target/`, then under either `debug` or `release`
depending on the build. The build produces a `stack_pivot_poc` binary which
must be run as root (or presumably with `CAP_SYS_BPF`).

Once running the eBPF programs will start tracking thread stacks and checking
for stack pivots, reporting events to userland for display by the userland
agent.

## Kubernetes

The PoC can be run on a kubernetes cluster by uploading the built docker image
to a docker registry accessible to the cluster's worker nodes. Use `docker tag`
to tag the local built image name to a `$registry/stack_pivot_poc` name, where
`$registry` is the ip/domain name of the registry, then use `docker push` to
push the image to the registry. An example registry is `localhost:8080`. The
example deployment yaml file `kubernetes/stack_pivot_poc.yaml` should then be
edited so the image name points to this repository. Once this is done the
deployment can be applied with `kubectl apply -f`, and later removed with
`kubectl delete -f`.

In my own testing I used a docker registry within the kubernetes cluster
itself. This involved installing a docker registry deployment via helm, taking
note of the internal cluster IP for the accompanying service, generating a
self-signed CA cert (and key) for the registry service (with appropriate
Subject Alternative Name for the IP/url of the service), placing this cert and
its accompanying key in a tls secret for the cluster, providing this secret
name to the docker-registry deployment by using `--set` with the
`tlsSecretName` value and running `helm upgrade`, and finally placing the
certificate on worker nodes under `/etc/docker/certs.d/$registry/ca.crt`, where
`$registry` is the ip/url of the registry, such as `10.43.250.40:5000`. This
way the worker node can successfully authenticate the internal registry's
certificate and pull the image. Finally, using the notes given by the helm
chart for docker-registry when installing, we can use `kubectl port-forward` to
access the internal registry's service via localhost, letting us push the image
to the cluster-internal registry. Now when deploying the PoC deployment, the
image can be pulled from the cluster-internal docker registry.

# Testing

Tests are under 'test' and are currently manual. Running programs normally
installed and under normal use should _never_ result in a "stack pivot" alert.
However certain programs under 'test' should stack pivot at some point, cause
an alert, and if enabled, be killed immediately by a SIGKILL from within eBPF.

Build tests with `make`, and run them before the main userland agent (under
`target`) or after, to test different start orders of our agent & of protected
workloads. We should detect/kill actual stack pivots whenever possible, and
_never_ kill legitimate processes.

## Building/Running Tests

Some of the test programs require extra toolchains to be installed.

### C#

Follow the instructions from the official Mono website https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin

The Makefile handles building with the `mcs` utility, run with `mono program.exe`.

Here is running the "csharp_task_example.cs" test
```
$ mono csharp_task_example.exe
pid 5078
Creating 100 Tasks
Starting 100 Tasks
Waiting for 100 Tasks
Task=1, obj=0, Thread=4
Task=2, obj=1, Thread=5
Task=3, obj=2, Thread=6
Task=4, obj=3, Thread=5
Task=5, obj=4, Thread=4
...
```

### Erlang

Install Erlang with `apt install erlang`. An Erlang program can be
built from the Erlang shell, started with `erl`. A module can be built/loaded
with `c(module_name).`, then an exported function called with `module_name:function().`.

Exit the Erlang shell with `init:stop().`.


Here is running the "erlang_process.erl" test.
```
$ erl
Erlang/OTP 24 [erts-12.2.1] [source] [64-bit] [smp:2:2] [ds:2:2:10] [async-threads:1] [jit]

Eshell V12.2.1  (abort with ^G)
1> c(erlang_process).
{ok,erlang_process}
2> erlang_process:start().
<0.87.0>"hello" "process"
<0.88.0>"hello" "forloop"
<0.89.0>"hello" "forloop"
<0.90.0>"hello" "forloop"
<0.91.0>"hello" "forloop"
<0.92.0>"hello" "forloop"
[1,1,1,1,1]
3> init:stop().
ok
4>
$
```

### Golang

Given `program.go`, run with `go run program.go`.

### Kotlin + GraalVM

Install the `kotlinc` compiler. On Ubuntu this is in the `kotlin` package.
Then follow the instructions to download + install GraalVM
https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/

Enable using GraalVM by running `source use_graalvm.sh` in the tests directory.
This is covered in the install instructions, adding the GraalVM install
directory to PATH and JAVA_HOME. This way we can enable as necessary, rather
than system-wide.

Install the `native-image` plugin using the GraalVM Updater with `gu install
native-image`. This is for building a native ELF executable from a jar file.

You can make sure you're using the GraalVM in a shell by running `java -version`
and making sure "GraalVM" appears in the output.

#### Gradle-based build process

Seems like using Gradle is better for incorporating dependencies, which it
seems we have to do for coroutines in Kotlin.

We need to install Gradle from our usual repositories, then get an updated
wrapper so that we can _actually_ use an up-to-date Gradle that's compatible
with everything we'll be using. Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 7.5.1`
in the project directory to get a newer version of gradle. Then we can
use `./gradlew` for this project to build an run.

Now we can build a native image with `./gradlew nativeBuild`, and find the
result in the `app/build/native/nativeBuild/` directory.

# TODO

* Refactor & simplify code
** refactor data structures, event types as necessary (less userland events)
** double-check that we pull in updates from Anthony's code
* make eBPF programs for syscalls an exploit is likely to use, check user sp against known stack regions
** failing check gets kill signal sent immediately
* Revisit `check_stack_pivot` logic, simplify function
* test against go binaries
* test program which takes input string describing clones/forks/execves to do (randomly by default) for better stress testing of dealing with process/thread creation.
* heavier testing against expected workload binaries (nginx, nodejs/go/java apps)

# Caveats

A Stack Pivot is not necessary for all ROP chains, so this is a detection only
for a certain ROP-based exploitation technique, not ROP-based exploits in
general.  This can make a ROP-based exploit harder (or in certain situations
unfeasible), but not impossible.

It is also possible an exploit could avoid using the syscalls we are checking for
stack pivots at, or could simply manipulate process memory to accomplish its goals
and avoid syscalls entirely.

# Appendix

Miscellaneous useful things.

## pid/tid & tgid/pid

From a userland perspective, every process has a "Process ID" (PID), and each
thread in a process has a "Thread ID" (TID). A process has one or more threads.
Every thread belongs to a process. These identifiers can be retrieved by the
`getpid` and `gettid` syscalls. However in the kernel, we have a "Thread Group
ID" (TGID) and a "Process ID" (PID). From the kernel's perspective, we simply
have tasks (with PIDs) which belong to thread groups (which have a TGID). The
thread group leader has a PID which matches the TGID. This causes some
confusion, but is essentially just a change in terminology.

| userland | kernel |
|----------|--------|
|   pid    |  tgid  |
|   tid    |   pid  |
